# modmarg
predicted margins and marginals effects

# v1.0

* Can take the predictive levels of a continuous or discrete variable
* Can take the predictive effects (dydx) of a discrete variable
* Supports interactions
* Models: OLS, Logit
* Test suite

# v2.0

* Can take the predictive effects (dydx) of a continuous variable
* Inverse probability weights
* Clustered standard errors

# TODO

* More model types (e.g., that aren't already part of glm)
