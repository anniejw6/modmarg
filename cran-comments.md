Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

CRAN repository db overrides:
  X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2020-04-09 as check problems were not
    corrected despite reminders.

This package was previously accepted, but I did not get around to updating
it with the latest R release. That is now remedied.

Stata (referencing the statistical software) is spelled correctly, see, e.g.,
